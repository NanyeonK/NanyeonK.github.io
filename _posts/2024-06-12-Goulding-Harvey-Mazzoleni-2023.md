# Concept
1. Use Time-series Momentum to take long and short positions based on the trend.   
2. Authors distinguish between SLOW momentum based on the average return among the 12 months and FAST momentum, based on the return over a one-month period.   
3. To analyze the perisitence of expected returns and the noise in realized returns, authors use an AR(1) model.   
4. The market diveided into four cycles.   
5. Combine SLOW and FAST to form a medium speed momentum strategy.   
6. Each market cycle is linked to macroeconomic indicators and buisness cycles.
